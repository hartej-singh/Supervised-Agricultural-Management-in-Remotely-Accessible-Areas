# Supervised-Agricultural-Management-in-Remotely-Accessible-Areas
In our prototype with the use of 3 sensory devices, we collect necessary data relating to agricultural environment that affects humidity level situated in a remote area. This data is sent to Arduino which does the instantaneous detection, control and correction of the environment. We also use the GSM module embedded in Arduino to transmit the data over Cloud to the end-user which makes use of Deep Learning techniques to predict future fuel requirements for the on-site electricity generator to operate the humidity controller.
